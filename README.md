## Check Your Understanding
1. I would fit my automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed in my Recipe project development pipeline to ensure that any errors are caught early on on the development process rather than later. It ensures that new code doesn't fail any tests when making progress on the project.
2. I would not use an end-to-end test to check if a function is returning the right output because an end-to-end test tests an entire application whereas testing a function is small and requires a unit test.
