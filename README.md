## Check Your Understanding
1. I would fit my automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed in my Recipe project development pipeline to ensure that any errors are caught early on on the development process rather than later. It ensures that new code doesn't fail any tests when making progress on the project.
2. I would not use an end-to-end test to check if a function is returning the right output because an end-to-end test tests an entire application whereas testing a function is small and requires a unit test.
3. The difference between navigation mode and snapshot mode is when the page is analyzed. Navigation mode analyzes a page after it loads whereas snapshot mode analyzes a page in its current state.
4. Based on the Lighthouse results, we could improve accessibility, best practices, and SEO. In order to improve accessibility, we need to ensure that the html element has a lang attribute. In order to improve the best practices, we need to add a meta viewport tag to accommodate to different screen sizes. Finally we can improve SEO by adding a meta description so users can understand the page's content.
